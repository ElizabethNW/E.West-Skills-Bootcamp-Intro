      -   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
      -   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhones and androids.
      -   A fair amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
   
## DEPLOYMENT

-   ####    GitHub Pages

    The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

      -   Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
      -   At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button 
                on the menu.
      -   Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
      -   Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
                The page will automatically refresh.

-   ####        Forking the GitHub Repository

       By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub
            account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using
            the following steps:
       -   Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
       -   At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, 
                locate the "Fork" Button.
       -   You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
